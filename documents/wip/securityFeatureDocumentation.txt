LSB Specification Proposal

State: Problem Statement
------


Problem Statement:
------------------

It can be difficult for application providers to install their products on Linux
systems that have security features turned on compared to those with the
features turned off. Documentation is needed to guide application providers
for how to build their applications and installers for systems with SELinux and
AppArmor in use as well as for non-secured systems.

Many customers today want to use their preferred applications in a secure environment.
A number of commercial applications are programmed to use more system facilities
than are allowed to them in the secured environment. To complete the installation and
run successfully, they advise the customer to turn off the security feature. The
customer is then forced to make a decision between a more secure environment and
using the application. Clearer advice on how to set up applications in secured
environments would assist application providers in working within the environment.

Ubuntu and openSUSE ship with AppArmor turned on by default.
Fedora ships with SELinux turned on by default.


(Proposed) Solution:
--------------------

Create guideline documentation for applications for installing and running within
typical SELinux and AppArmor environments compared to environments not using them.


Solution Discussion Links:
--------------------------

Provide links to at least 3 distribution mailing lists where this topic has
been discussed.


Solution Rationale:
-------------------

Provide a brief description how the documented solution was derived.


Distributions Support:
----------------------

A list of distributions that have pledged to adhere to this specification and
integrate the test into their QA suite.


Verification Test:
------------------

Documentation, testing not required
